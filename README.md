## Project Specs

This is a refactored version of a project I did during school, it renders a complete list of videogames either by a category/genre or search and shows available deals while providing links of where to purchase. The original project dubbed 'Kraken's Cove', and did not provide nearly as much detailed data about specific video games as this current version. Outer Dimensional Deals has a heavier potential as it offers lazy loading, custom hooks, and better error handling than it's predacessor. 

## Illustrations 



## Future Features

- Testing (Vice/Jest)
- Small bug in rendering the location screen (requires global state management)
- Location screen requires custom animations 
- Error Component needs to be built (custom animations)
- Better rendering of video game screenshots (extremely blurry)
- Profile/Login (User should be able to have to ability to customise)
- Redux (should debug the locations issue that occurs when return to a page..)
